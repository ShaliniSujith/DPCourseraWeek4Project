Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

Objective of this project was to:

Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box
Share your server.R and ui.R code on github

****Explore BC Liquor Store****
Created a shiny app using a data set that explore data set available at BC Liquor Store.

From the raw data I have removed some columns, renamed other columns, and dropped a few rare factor levels.

****What does the application do****
The app details the liquor price range, the product types and the country it belongs.

The user can choose:

Price range
Liquor types
Country
Based on the selection on the right hand side a histogram will be shown which displays the alcohol content in the 3 liquor types.

****Application is running on****
